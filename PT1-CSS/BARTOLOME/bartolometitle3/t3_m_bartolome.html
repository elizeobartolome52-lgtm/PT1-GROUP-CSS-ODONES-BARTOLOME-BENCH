<h2>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>The researchers will be going to make a plan for the robot and the blueprint of the complete robot.
 Afterwards, the researcher will be going to list and collect all the materials needed to build the said
 robot thought shopee which is an online shopping platform. Next, the researchers will create the robot in a workshop.</p>
<br>
<h3>Preparation of making the robot</h3>
<p>The researchers will build the robot using the collected parts and a designated working area. Before constructing the robot itself, the researchers will develop a flowchart outlining all the actions of the robot in the correct order. This is to ensure that the researchers have a clear guide prior to coding the robot and its pathfinding algorithm, which is the A* search algorithm.
Next, the researchers will proceed to construct the robot based on the blueprint and the flowchart they created. Afterwards, the researcher will utilize the Arduino programming language, which is a modified variation of C++, through the Arduino IDE. According to Sarraf (2025), the Arduino IDE is beneficial due to its quick setup and deployment, extensive community support, comprehensive documentation, and wide availability. This platform will be used to code the robot, as it is designed to operate using Arduino components.
Furthermore, the researchers will transfer the source code to the robot via an Arduino Micro USB 2 and connect it to the device.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Testing of the robot</h3>
<p>After the robot has been fully coded and completed, the researcher will conduct a test to determine the efficiency of the robot. A large testing area, approximately 10 by 10 meters, will be prepared. The researchers will scatter various waste products throughout the area to evaluate the following: the accuracy of the robot in identifying different types of waste products; the speed and time taken by the robot to detect and collect different types of waste; the maximum range at which the robot can detect waste; and the maximum amount of waste the robot can collect across different waste types. The researchers will conduct the test using three sets of ten trials, each with different placements of the waste products. Each trial will last up to five minutes and will contain 50 different waste items, with an increase of 10 waste products between each set of trials.</p>
<br>
<h3>Data analysis</h3>
<p>The researchers will use a one-way multivariate analysis of variance, or one-way MANOVA, because the efficiency of the robot is evaluated based on multiple dependent variables. These include the accuracy of the robot in identifying different types of waste products, the speed and time it takes to detect and collect the waste, and the maximum amount of different waste products the robot can collect. The researchers will collect data on the robot’s accuracy, its speed, the time it requires to collect the waste products, and its maximum collection capacity in each trial.</p>
