<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<h3>Research Design</h3>
<p>The experiment is to glaze clay pots using latex paint — therefore this study is
experimental. The researchers will evaluate the characteristics of the clay pots through
determining the resistance of the pot and it's brittleness when subjected to different
temperature test such as being exposed to sunlight, radiation and heat from oven, and inside
the freezer. The exposure to heat from the sun, and the heat and radiation from the oven
determines the resistance of the pot while placing it inside the freezer determines the pots
brittleness. </p>
<br>
<h3>Materials and Procedure</h3>
<p>First, prepare the following materials and equipment: clay pots, latex paint, a
paintbrush, a clean area to work in, and safety equipment such as gloves, an apron, and a
mask to ensure safety and cleanliness. After preparing the materials, begin painting the pots
with the paintbrush using latex paint (Note: Only half of each pot should be painted, so the
other half can be used as a comparison to the modified pots). While painting, ensure that all
pots receive the same number of strokes and amount of latex paint, so the experiment remains
consistent across all pots. Also, make sure to paint both the inside and outside of the clay
pots. After painting, place the pots in a clean and safe area and allow them to dry before
starting the experimentation. </p>
<br>
<h3>Experimental Pots</h3>
<p>A total of 30 clay pots will be used in the experiment, with half of the pots glazed
with latex paint, and the other half used as a comparison. To create a pot glazed with latex
paint, first apply the latex paint to both the inside and outside of the clay pots, then wait for
them to dry before the experimentation begins. </p>
<br>
<h3>Experimental design</h3>
<p>There are a total of 30 clay pots, divided into 3 groups, each containing 5 clay pots
glazed with latex paint and 5 clay pots that are not modified. There will be 3 tests: exposing
the pots to the sun, placing them inside an oven, and placing them inside a freezer. The
diameter, height, shape, quality, and thickness of the pots will be consistent across all samples
to ensure there is no bias in the experiment. The quality of the clay pots glazed with latex
paint is the dependent variable, while the independent variables are the amount of latex paint,
the number of strokes, and the constant variables include the height, diameter, thickness,
quality of the pot, and the different experiments. In the solar radiation test, the clay pots will
be directly exposed to the sun from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM for 7 days to observe any effects of
sunlight on the pots. In the oven test, the pots will be subjected to 15-minute intervals at
increasing temperatures of 50°C, 75°C, and 100°C, with 1 hour between each trial. For the
freezer test, the pots will be placed inside a freezer at -212°F (-100°C) for 8 hours. After each
day of experimentation, observe the pots for cracks, breakage, or any deformities, and record
the observations. Then, compare the results of the different pots based on the amount of
damage done in each test to determine which pot performs the best. </p>
<br>
<h3>Statistical Test Analysis </h3>
<p>The researchers will utilize a one tailed t-test, hypothesis testing using ANOVA or
Analysis of variance.<br>
The researchers will utilize a t-test since the population and sample size are not significant,
with the sample population being less than 12 for each experiment. The study will use a onetailed test to determine if the null hypothesis will be rejected, as the scope is on whether the
variables are directly connected. In this case, only the positive critical region will be
considered, as the negative critical region relates to the possibility of an inverse correlation,
which is irrelevant to the study. The study will also use ANOVA to analyze whether the
differences between sample groups, which vary in the amount of latex paint used, are
statistically significant. </p>
