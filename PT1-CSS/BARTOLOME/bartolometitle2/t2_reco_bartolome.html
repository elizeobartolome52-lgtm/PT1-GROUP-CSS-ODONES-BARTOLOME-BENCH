<h2>RECOMMENDATION</h2>
<p>The researchers suggest that the temperature test must be try again, but with higher
temperature to see if the higher temperature really makes significant difference between the
two groups of pots in terms of number of deformities and its physical, mechanical, and
environmental properties. Additionally, the researchers also suggest experimenting with the
latex painted pots to other test like pressure test, drop test and other test to see the
performance of the latex painted pots to other situations, and also changing the amount of
coating of latex paint to the pot to see if the amount of coat affects the performance of the
pot.</p>
