<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Glazing the pot with latex paint will result in a significant difference compared to
commercial pots in terms of deformities and its physical, mechanical, and environmental
properties when exposed to extremely high temperatures, such as the heat inside the oven.
However, exposing the pots to lower temperatures, such as those inside the freezer or
outdoors, will not create a significant difference between the two groups of pots. The physical
properties of the latex-painted pots remain the same, while their mechanical properties, such
as hardness and toughness, improve. The brittleness of the latex-painted pots is slightly
reduced. The environmental properties of the latex-painted pots remain unchanged, except for
temperature, where the higher the temperature, the more significant the difference between
the two groups. </p>
