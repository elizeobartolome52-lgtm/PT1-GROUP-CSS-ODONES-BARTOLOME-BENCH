<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li> The Researchers will conduct a review of the existing literature and research on
organic watercolor. This will provide a foundation of knowledge and help for further
investigation.</li>
<br>
<li>Next Researchers will study the properties and investigate the environmental impact
of organic watercolor.</li>
<br>
<li>Then the Researchers will develop an experimental design that includes the selection
of organic pigments and other materials. They will determine the variables to be tested
for comparison.</li>
<br>
<li>Now the Researchers will conduct experiments to test the selected organic pigments
by observing and recording the color intensity, transparency, texture and other relevant
properties of the watercolor paints.</li>
<br>
<li>After the experimentation, the Researchers will now collect and record the data
obtained from the experiments.</li>
<br>
<li>After collecting data, the Researchers will now compare the results of the different
organic pigments to the characteristics of the manufactured watercolor like texture,
intensity of color, and pigment.</li>
<br>
<li>The Researchers also evaluating the organic watercolors and manufactured
watercolor in terms of their performance, quality, and suitability for watercolor painting.</li>
<br>
<li>Then, the Researchers will document the findings of the research in a clear and
organized manner by making charts, graphs, and visual representations of the
experimental results.</li>
<br>
<li>Afterwards, The Researchers will now provide recommendations for further research
or improvements in organic watercolor materials, techniques and suggest potential
avenues for future studies.</li>
