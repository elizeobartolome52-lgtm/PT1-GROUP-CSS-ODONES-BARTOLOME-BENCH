<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>The respondents seem to like watercolor that have too much pigment, the color is<br>
vibrant and intense, and the texture is good but the respondents sees a few<br>
problems like the organic watercolor is watery and it smells terrible which are cause<br>
by the changing of temperature of water and the amount of petals. At the same<br>
time, the respondents prefer organic watercolor because it is environmental friendly<br>
and does not contain any bad chemicals.</p>
